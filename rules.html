        <ol>
            <li>Each player rolls 2 six-sided dice at the beginning of their turn and the values are added together.</li>
            <li>If the player who is down material rolls a 7, they get to make two moves in a row!</li>
            <li>If the player who is up $k$ points of material, rolls a (7+k), then they get to make two moves in a row!</li>
        </ol>
